/**
 * @class AI2cDevice
 * @brief Abstract interface for I2C device operations
 *
 * This abstract class provides a hardware abstraction layer for I2C
 * communication, allowing for dependency injection and easier unit testing. By
 * implementing this interface, concrete classes can provide either real
 * hardware communication or mock implementations for testing.
 *
 * The interface wraps the essential I2C operations (open, read, write, and
 * address setting) into virtual methods that can be overridden by concrete
 * implementations.
