\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
mocks the request handling. 

The idea is to intercept the request and examine its content to see if the driver works as expected. To do so we will spin a node exposing the i2c service but the callback associated with the service will just call the mock service that we can control the behaviour of. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}

src/drivers/pca9685\+\_\+driver/test/include/Mock\+I2c\+Service.\+hpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
