\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
std\+::mutex wrapper with clang thread safety annotation 

The \doxylink{classMutex}{Mutex} class wraps a std\+::mutex instance to add clang thread safety annotation support. The class exposes the same interface as std\+::mutex and can be used as a transparent replacement. It integrates with the Mutex\+Locker and Condition\+Variable classes.

See \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex}{\texttt{ https\+://en.\+cppreference.\+com/w/cpp/thread/mutex}} for the complete API documentation. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
