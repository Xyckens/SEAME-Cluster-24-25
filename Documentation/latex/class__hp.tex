\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
class0 high precision fractional bit probability updates. @hp\+: motion vector high precision fractional bit probability updates.

This structure contains new values of motion vector probabilities. A value of zero in an array element means there is no update of the relevant probability. See {\ttfamily struct v4l2\+\_\+vp9\+\_\+prob\+\_\+updates} for details.
