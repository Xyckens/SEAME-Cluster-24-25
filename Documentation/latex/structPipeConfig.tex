The ImgU pipe configuration parameters.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The ImgU pipe configuration parameters. 

The ImgU image pipeline is composed of several hardware blocks that crop and scale the input image to obtain the desired output sizes. The scaling/cropping operations of those components is configured though the V4\+L2 selection API and the V4\+L2 subdev API applied to the ImgU media entity.

The configurable components in the pipeline are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item IF\+: image feeder
\item BDS\+: bayer downscaler
\item GDC\+: geometric distorsion correction
\end{DoxyItemize}

The IF crop rectangle is controlled by the V4\+L2\+\_\+\+SEL\+\_\+\+TGT\+\_\+\+CROP selection target applied to the ImgU media entity sink pad number 0. The BDS scaler is controlled by the V4\+L2\+\_\+\+SEL\+\_\+\+TGT\+\_\+\+COMPOSE target on the same pad, while the GDC output size is configured with the VIDIOC\+\_\+\+SUBDEV\+\_\+\+S\+\_\+\+FMT IOCTL, again on pad number 0.

The \doxylink{structPipeConfig}{Pipe\+Config} structure collects the sizes of each of those components plus the BDS scaling factor used to calculate the field of view of the final images. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
src/peripherals/camera/libcamera/src/libcamera/pipeline/ipu3/imgu.\+cpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
