# JetPackJoyRide - Cluster Implementation

## Introduction

The JetRacer Instrument Cluster Qt Application project aims to create a real-time speedometer for a JetRacer car. The application will run on a Raspberry Pi 4 and use the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol to receive speed data from a speed sensor. This project provides hands-on experience in software engineering, including embedded systems, communication protocols, and GUI development with Qt, a framework widely used in the automotive industry.

The successful completion of this project demonstrates the ability to design and implement real-world software solutions and effectively communicate results.
